## Decision Trees in MQL5: Classification and Regression

Decision trees are powerful machine learning algorithms that use a tree-like structure to make predictions. They work by splitting the data based on features (independent variables) into increasingly homogeneous subsets, ultimately reaching leaves representing the final prediction. MQL5 offers functionalities for implementing both **classification** and **regression** decision trees through the `tree.mqh` library.

**Decision Tree Theory (Basic Overview):**

1. **Start with the entire dataset at the root node.**
2. **Choose the feature and threshold that best splits the data into two subsets such that each subset is more homogeneous concerning the target variable (dependent variable).**
    * For classification, this often involves maximizing information gain or minimizing Gini impurity.
    * For regression, it involves maximizing variance reduction between the parent node and child nodes.
3. **Repeat step 2 for each child node recursively until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., reaching a maximum depth, minimum samples per node, or sufficient homogeneity).**
4. **Assign a prediction value to each leaf node.**
    * For classification, this is the most frequent class in the leaf node.
    * For regression, this is the average value of the target variable in the leaf node.

**CDecisionTreeClassifier Class:**

This class implements a decision tree for classification tasks. It offers the following functionalities:

* `CDecisionTreeClassifier(uint min_samples_split=2, uint max_depth=2, mode mode_=MODE_GINI)` Constructor, allows setting hyperparameters (minimum samples per split, maximum tree depth, and splitting criterion).
* `~CDecisionTreeClassifier(void)` Destructor.
* `void fit(const matrix &x, const vector &y)` Trains the model on the provided data (`x` - independent variables, `y` - class labels).
* `void print_tree(Node *tree, string indent=" ",string padl=")` Prints the tree structure in a readable format.
* `double predict(const vector &x)` Predicts the class label for a new data point (`x`).
* `vector predict(const matrix &x)` Predicts class labels for multiple new data points (`x`).

**CDecisionTreeRegressor Class:**

This class inherits from `CDecisionTreeClassifier` and specializes in regression tasks. It overrides specific functions and implements different splitting criteria:

* `CDecisionTreeRegressor(uint min_samples_split=2, uint max_depth=2):` Constructor, allows setting hyperparameters (minimum samples per split and maximum tree depth).
* `~CDecisionTreeRegressor(void):` Destructor.
* `void fit(matrix &x, vector &y):` Trains the model on the provided data (`x` - independent variables, `y` - continuous values).
* `double predict(const vector &x)` Predicts the continuous value for a new data point (`x`).

**Additional Notes:**

* Both classes use internal helper functions for building the tree, calculating splitting criteria (information gain, Gini impurity, variance reduction), and making predictions.
* The `check_is_fitted` function ensures the model is trained before allowing predictions.
* Choosing appropriate hyperparameters (especially maximum depth) is crucial to avoid overfitting the model.

By understanding the theoretical foundation and functionalities of the `CDecisionTreeClassifier` and `CDecisionTreeRegressor` classes, MQL5 users can leverage decision trees for classification and regression tasks within their programs.
