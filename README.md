This repository hosts the development of the MALE 5 library

## About MALE5

MALE5 is a machine learning repository for creating trading systems in the c++ like, MQL5 programming language.
It was developed to help build machine learning based trading robots, effortlessly in the [MetaTrader5](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/automated-trading/metaeditor) platform

This Library is:

-   **Simple to use** You can literly start building your system once you call class constructor
-   **Flexible** You can use it any program scripts, Indicator, EA's
-   **Resources cheap** It doesn't consume a lot of memory neither the CPU, takes short time intervals to train

**ML Algorithms Available:**

*currently there are not many algorithms ready as I am a solodev finding a way through*

-   Linear Regression
-   Logistic Regression
-   Polynomial Regression
-   ridge  & Laso Regression
-   Classification decision tree
-   Naive bayes
-   FeedForward Neural Network
-   KNN nearest neighbors

**Clustering techniques | Unsupervised Learning:**

-   KNN clustering 

## Installing 

Create a directory with the name MALE5 under your include directory in Metaeditor then open the command terminal in that directory and type 

``` cmd
    git clone https://github.com/MegaJoctan/MALE5.git
```

## Running python Scripts

To run python scripts found in this repo, make sure you have activated virtualEnvironment in your cmd terminal then run 
`pip install requirements.txt`

After that you will be good to go.

## Read the Docs

There is a short clear description on how to use this library on this repository wiki [https://github.com/MegaJoctan/MALE5/wiki](https://github.com/MegaJoctan/MALE5/wiki)

## Opening an issue

You can also post **bug reports and feature requests** (only)
in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/MegaJoctan/MALE5/issues).
