# MALE5: Machine Learning for MQL5

![MALE5](MALE5.png)

This repository hosts the development of the MALE 5 library

## About MALE5

MALE5 is a machine learning repository for creating trading systems in the c++ like, MQL5 programming language.
It was developed to help build machine learning based trading robots, effortlessly in the [MetaTrader5](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/automated-trading/metaeditor) platform

This Library is:

-   **Simple to use** You can literly start building your system once you call class constructor
-   **Flexible** You can use it any program scripts, Indicator, EA's
-   **Resources cheap** It doesn't consume a lot of memory neither the CPU, takes short time intervals to train

**ML Algorithms Available:**

*currently there are not many algorithms ready as I am a solodev finding a way through*

-   Linear Regression
-   Logistic Regression
-   Polynomial Regression
-   ridge  & Laso Regression
-   Classification decision tree
-   Naive bayes
-   FeedForward Neural Network
-   KNN nearest neighbors

**Clustering techniques | Unsupervised Learning:**

-   KNN clustering
