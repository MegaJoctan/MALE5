This repository hosts the development of the MALE 5 library

## About MALE5

MALE5 is a machine learning repository for creating trading systems in the c++ like, MQL5 programming language.
It was developed to help build machine learning based trading robots, effortlessly in the [MetaTrader5](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/automated-trading/metaeditor) platform

This Library is:

-   **Simple to use:** You can literally start building your system once you call class constructor
-   **Flexible:** You can use it in any program scripts, Indicator, EA's
-   **Resource-efficient:** It doesn't consume a lot of memory nor CPU, takes short time intervals to train

## ML Algorithms Available
**Linear Models**

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Ridge & Lasso Regression

**Decision Tree**
